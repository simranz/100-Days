# 100-Days
Let's try to code for 100 days and see how far I can get

The snippets here would be using various languages JS, CF, PHP or might even be more 

## Current progress
### Day1
Starting small. A js snippet which takes in a phrase and writes it one by one on each key press as you type in the textarea. 
### Day2
A simple tic tac toe game with Vanilla JS 

## Plan for the next day: 
Todo list using Vanilla JS and store in localStorage
